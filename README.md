# Parallax Scroll Effect Showcase

This project demonstrates a parallax scroll effect implemented in a website using JavaScript and CSS. The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by moving different layers of content at different speeds while scrolling, resulting in a visually engaging user experience.

## Overview

The website incorporates parallax scrolling to create depth and dynamism within the content. It consists of multiple layers that move in response to the user's scroll actions, providing a sense of depth and immersion.

### Globals

The implementation defines various global variables to manage scroll events, window dimensions, and the configurations of parallax layers.

### Parallax Layers

Different sections of the website act as distinct parallax layers, each moving at a different speed in response to scroll behavior. These layers are strategically designed to create a sense of depth and visual interest.

### Animation/Scrolling Functions

The script contains functions that update the position of each layer based on the user's scrolling behavior. As the user scrolls, these functions dynamically adjust the position of each layer to create the parallax effect.

### Helpers

Utility functions are included to facilitate smooth scrolling and handle any potential errors or compatibility issues that may arise across various devices and browsers.

## Usage

To integrate this parallax scroll effect into a website:

1. Include the provided JavaScript and CSS files in your project.
2. Configure parallax layers within your HTML markup, assigning different elements to act as distinct layers.
3. Initialize the parallax scroll script to activate the effect.

Ensure the layers are structured and styled appropriately to achieve the desired visual depth and scrolling behavior.

## Compatibility

This parallax scroll effect may require adjustments based on specific content structures and design preferences. Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience.
